# Unified Kill Chain ‚Äî CTF Exercise

This write-up documents a CTF-style quiz where I matched actions to the correct **Unified Kill Chain (UKC)** phases. The exercise tested quick recognition of which phase a given action belongs to.

## üéØ What the CTF Is
A multiple-choice matching game: for each prompt, select the UKC phase that best fits the described action. Correct answers progress you toward the flag; consecutive correct answers contribute to a win streak.

## üìù What I Did
- Reviewed the prompt for each question and selected the UKC phase I believed matched the action.  
- Consulted study material beforehand to refresh concepts, which helped maintain accuracy across consecutive questions.

---

## üîç Observations & Notes
- The quiz reinforced how the UKC phases map to real attacker behaviors (recon ‚Üí persistence ‚Üí C2 ‚Üí pivot ‚Üí actions).  
- Consulting study notes before attempting helped build a **win streak**, demonstrating that quick review plus conceptual understanding improves performance in timed/quiz-style exercises.

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome & Reflection
- Successfully answered all prompts and obtained the flag.  
- The exercise was a useful quick-check of UKC knowledge and highlighted the value of short refreshers before hands-on challenges or timed assessments.
