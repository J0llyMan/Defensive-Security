# Diamond Model ‚Äî CTF Exercise

This write-up documents a CTF-style exercise based on the **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis**. The task required completing eight sections of the diamond by choosing the correct option for each prompt; correct answers light up the corresponding diamond segment.

## üéÆ What the CTF Is
A multiple-choice quiz where each correct selection fills one part of the diamond (Adversary, Victim, Capability, Infrastructure, etc.). The diamond turns green for each correct answer and awards a flag at completion.

## üìù What I Did
- Reviewed the study notes for the Diamond Model briefly before starting.  
- Went through each multiple-choice prompt and selected the option that best matched the diamond element described.  
- Observed the visual feedback (diamond segments lighting green) to confirm correct answers.

---

## üîç Observations & Notes
- The interaction model (select ‚Üí segment lights) is an effective immediate-feedback learning tool.  
- Pre-reading the study material before attempting the quiz helped maintain accuracy across all questions and contributed to a clean run to the flag.  
- The Diamond Model‚Äôs components are more conceptual; this exercise reinforced the mapping between terminology (e.g., Adversary, Capability, Infrastructure) and practical examples.

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome & Reflection
- Successfully completed the challenge and obtained the flag (see **CTF24.png**).  
- The quiz was a solid reinforcement of Diamond Model vocabulary and structure; useful for tabletop discussions or post-incident analysis, even if less directly actionable in live SOC detection workflows.
