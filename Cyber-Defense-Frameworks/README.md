# Cyber Defense Frameworks

This module covers my hands-on learning and practical application of **Cyber Defense Frameworks**.  
It is organized into two main areas: **Frameworks** and **CTFs**.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

### 1. Frameworks
This folder contains the frameworks I have studied, including:

- **Pyramid of Pain** ‚Äì Understanding adversary indicators and their impact on defense strategies  
- **Cyber Kill Chain** ‚Äì Identification and prevention of network intrusions by analyzing attack phases  
- **Unified Kill Chain** ‚Äì Phases of an attack and mitigation strategies for IT assets  
- **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis** ‚Äì Core features: adversary, infrastructure, capability, and victim  
- **MITRE Framework** ‚Äì Resources and methodologies provided by MITRE for threat analysis  

Each framework is documented in its own Markdown file, with:

- Key concepts and principles  
- Diagrams and visual representations  
- Practical applications and insights from labs  

**Folder:** `Frameworks/`

### 2. CTFs
This folder contains Capture the Flag exercises where I applied the frameworks in realistic scenarios.  
Each CTF file includes:

- Scenario description and objectives  
- Step-by-step actions taken  
- Framework principles applied  
- Screenshots or diagrams for clarity  
- Lessons learned  

**Folder:** `CTFs/`

## üîß Tools & Technologies Used
During these labs and exercises, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Threat Modeling & Framework Analysis:** MITRE ATT&CK, Cyber Kill Chain, Diamond Model, Pyramid of Pain  
- **Endpoint Monitoring:** EDR tools and lab simulations  
- **Lab Environments:** VirtualBox, VMware, OpenVPN and Windows/Linux VMs  
- **Documentation & Reporting:** Markdown, diagrams, lab notes, screenshots

## üå± Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, I have:

- Built a strong understanding of **cyber defense frameworks**  
- Learned how to **apply theoretical frameworks in practical CTF exercises**  
- Developed a strong understanding of **network security concepts, endpoint monitoring principles, and threat analysis frameworks**
- Strengthened analytical thinking and systematic problem-solving in cybersecurity

‚≠ê **Note:** While some labs and exercises were guided by platforms like TryHackMe, the majority of the work reflects **independent hands-on experimentation and practical application**.
