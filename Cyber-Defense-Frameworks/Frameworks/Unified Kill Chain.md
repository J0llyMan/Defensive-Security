# ‚öîÔ∏è Unified Kill Chain

Learning this framework was **extremely easy and familiar** because it builds upon the Cyber Kill Chain.  
What I find incredible and fascinating is how the **Unified Kill Chain** can integrate other frameworks (like MITRE ATT&CK), making it one of the **most comprehensive high-level analysis** tools for mapping attacker behavior and planning defensive coverage.

---

## üß© Overview

The Unified Kill Chain expands on traditional kill-chain thinking by **unifying multiple models and data sources** into a single, flexible sequence of attack phases.  
This makes it particularly useful for **high-level analysis**, threat modeling, and mapping detections from sources such as MITRE ATT&CK.

## üîç Core Concepts

- **Integrative:** Maps phases to other frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK), allowing defenders to translate high-level analysis into actionable detection and response items.  
- **Modular:** Can incorporate telemetry from network, endpoint, and threat-intel feeds for richer situational awareness.  
- **Practical for SOCs:** Helps analysts prioritize detections and hunting activities by showing where incidents sit in the attack lifecycle.

## üí° Why It Matters

- Because it **builds on the Cyber Kill Chain**, it feels intuitive while offering **broader coverage**.  
- Its ability to **link to MITRE ATT&CK** and other resources makes it ideal for high-level reporting, playbook creation, and gap analysis across people, process, and technology.  
- Great for teams that need a single model to coordinate detection, response, and threat intelligence.

## üß† Reflection

This framework reinforced how important it is to **connect theory to telemetry** ‚Äî not just knowing attack phases, but being able to map them to logs, alerts, and mitigation actions.  
Using the Unified Kill Chain in lab scenarios helped me see how frameworks can be layered to provide deeper, more actionable analysis.
