# 💎 Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

The **Diamond Model** focuses on understanding cyber intrusions by mapping four core features — **Adversary**, **Victim**, **Capability**, and **Infrastructure**.  
Each intrusion can be visualized as a diamond, showing how these elements interact to form an attack event.

## 🧩 Overview

This framework helps analysts **correlate data and understand relationships** between different intrusion events.  
It provides a structured way to describe attacks and can be useful for **threat intelligence teams** or during **post-incident reporting**.

---

## 💡 Reflection

I found the **Diamond Model** to be the least practical framework when applied directly to CTFs or simulated SOC work.  
While it offers an interesting way to conceptualize relationships between actors and actions, it’s not particularly actionable in hands-on detection or mitigation workflows.

That said, it could have real value in **tabletop exercises**, **incident retrospectives**, or **red team engagements**, where understanding the attacker’s motivations, capabilities, and infrastructure is more important than immediate defense.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **Adversary:** The entity (person or group) behind the intrusion.  
- **Infrastructure:** The systems and tools used to deliver or control the attack.  
- **Capability:** The malware, exploit, or method employed.  
- **Victim:** The target or entity affected by the intrusion.

## 🧠 Takeaway

While it may not enhance hands-on detection workflows, the **Diamond Model** offers valuable structure for **contextualizing attacks** and **sharing intelligence** between analysts or organizations.
