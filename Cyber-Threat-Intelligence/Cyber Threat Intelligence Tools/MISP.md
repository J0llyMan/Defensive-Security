# MISP – Malware Information Sharing Platform

## Overview

**MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)** is an open-source threat intelligence platform designed to **collect, store, and share Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** and other cybersecurity-related data within trusted communities. It facilitates collaboration between organisations by enabling them to exchange actionable intelligence on malware, attacks, and threat actors.

MISP operates on a **distributed model**, supporting closed, semi-private, and open sharing communities. This flexibility makes it suitable for enterprises, CERTs, SOC teams, and even law enforcement.

## Exploring MISP

When I first accessed MISP’s dashboard, the platform immediately highlighted its open-source nature and its focus on **sharing more with friends than adversaries** which is the heart of MISP’s philosophy. The diagram shown above visualises how threat intelligence flows between communities, helping establish a clear data-sharing pipeline.

What stood out during exploration was MISP’s emphasis on **community-driven sharing**. Whether you are part of a national CERT, a corporate SOC, or a research lab, MISP encourages collaboration through shared IOCs and event data, reducing duplication of effort across teams.

## Visualization and Dashboards

MISP’s interface offers clean and intuitive **visualisation dashboards**, making it simple to track events, relationships, and data correlations. You can easily switch between analytical views, event graphs, and lists of correlated attributes. This makes investigations faster and more structured, especially when dealing with large threat data sets.

The visual interface also supports **data enrichment** from integrated sources, providing additional intelligence about IOCs with just a few clicks.

## Core Features and Use Cases

MISP’s primary goal is to make threat data **actionable and shareable**. Its features support multiple cybersecurity workflows:

- **IOC Database:** Stores detailed indicators and context about malware, incidents, and threat actors.  
- **Automatic Correlation:** Highlights relationships between attributes and attack campaigns automatically.  
- **Data Sharing Models:** Enables closed, semi-private, and public data exchange.  
- **Import/Export Integrations:** Connects with systems like **SIEMs, NIDS, and HIDS**.  
- **Event Graphs:** Visualises how individual events and attributes connect.  
- **API Support:** Allows for seamless integration with other platforms.

These features make MISP valuable for malware analysis, forensic investigation, and even strategic threat intelligence sharing.

## Galaxy and Tagging

One of MISP’s strongest aspects is its **Galaxy** system — a structured knowledge base containing information about threat actors, malware families, and attack campaigns. These galaxies are connected to **tags and taxonomies**, helping analysts quickly classify and contextualize new threats.

Tags are extremely versatile in MISP. They can be applied to both events and individual attributes, and they follow best practices that promote consistency:
- Use **Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)** tags to control information flow.  
- Apply **Confidence** tags to indicate data reliability.  
- Add **Origin** and **Permissible Action** tags to describe the data’s source and intended use.

This tagging and classification system ensures intelligence is both machine-readable and human-friendly.

## The Heart of Sharing

MISP’s motto, *“Sharing more with friends than adversaries do,”* captures the essence of what makes it such a critical platform in cybersecurity collaboration. The “Art of Sharing” encourages trust among participants while maintaining strong governance models to prevent data misuse.

For analysts and defenders, MISP represents a shift from working in isolation to **building a collective intelligence network**, where knowledge shared by one defender can protect many others.

## Final Thoughts

MISP is more than just a data-sharing tool — it’s a **collaborative ecosystem** for managing and distributing threat intelligence.  
Its ability to **integrate with other platforms like OpenCTI and TheHive**, along with its **support for MITRE ATT&CK mapping**, makes it one of the most versatile and comprehensive open-source CTI tools available today.

I also completed a **hands-on MISP project**, where I explored tagging, event creation, and data correlation exercises.  
Similar to my previous work, I’ve placed this project under the **CTFs & Projects** folder for better categorisation and reader accessibility.
