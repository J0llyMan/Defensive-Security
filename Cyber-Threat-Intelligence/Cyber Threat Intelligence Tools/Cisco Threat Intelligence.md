- **Detection Research** ‚Äì Analyzes malware and vulnerabilities to create detection rules and signatures  
- **Engineering & Development** ‚Äì Maintains inspection engines and ensures detection tools are up-to-date  
- **Vulnerability Research & Discovery** ‚Äì Works with vendors to identify and report vulnerabilities  
- **Communities** ‚Äì Manages open-source initiatives and community engagement

## üí° Practical Usage & Findings

- Used **Talos Reputation Center** to investigate the `tryhackme.com` domain  
- Explored **top email sender countries** and spam origins  
- Talos provides actionable intelligence beyond what VirusTotal offers, including email traffic analysis, vulnerability timelines, and global threat visibility

## üß† Reflection

I frequently use Cisco Talos in addition to VirusTotal because of its **comprehensive modules**, which provide a broad range of threat intelligence from IP and domain analysis to spam and malware insights.  
The platform is highly practical for **CTI analysts, SOC operations, and incident response teams**.
