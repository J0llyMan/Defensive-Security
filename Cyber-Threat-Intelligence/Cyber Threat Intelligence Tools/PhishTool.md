## ðŸ§  Reflection

PhishTool is particularly valuable because OSINT is already integrated, providing **actionable intelligence directly from the tool**.  
It complements traditional CLI-based analysis workflows, making it a versatile addition to an email analystâ€™s toolkit. In my own experience investigating phishing emails, I often prefer **command-line tools** like `olevba`, `cat`, `grep`, `md5sum`, combined with uploading files to malware analysis sites.
PhishToolâ€™s built-in OSINT, however, makes it extremely useful for rapid investigations.
