# üß† Cyber Threat Intelligence

This module covers my hands-on learning and practical application of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).  
It is organized into two main areas: **Threat Intelligence Tools** and **CTFs & Projects**.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

### 1. Threat Intelligence Tools
This folder contains the CTI tools and platforms I have studied and practiced with, including:

- **Yara** ‚Äì Writing and using Yara rules for malware analysis, forensics, and threat hunting  
- **OpenCTI** ‚Äì Understanding the structure and visualization of threat data  
- **MISP** ‚Äì Learning how to share and correlate threat indicators effectively  
- **URLScan.io** ‚Äì An online tool for scanning and analyzing websites to detect potential phishing, malware, or malicious behavior  
- **Abuse.ch** ‚Äì A research project by the Institute for Cybersecurity and Engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. It provides several operational platforms used for tracking malware and botnets:
  - **Malware Bazaar** ‚Äì A resource for sharing malware samples  
  - **Feodo Tracker** ‚Äì Tracks botnet command and control (C2) servers associated with Emotet, Dridex, and TrickBot  
  - **SSL Blacklist** ‚Äì Provides blocklists of malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints  
  - **URL Haus** ‚Äì Shares malware distribution URLs and helps with domain takedowns  
  - **Threat Fox** ‚Äì Shares Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IPs, hashes, and domains  
- **PhishTool** ‚Äì Used for investigating and analyzing phishing emails to extract threat intelligence  
- **Cisco Talos Intelligence** ‚Äì Provides detailed threat data, malware research, and global threat intelligence for proactive defense
- **VirusTotal** ‚Äì Aggregating antivirus and sandbox results to analyze files, URLs, and IPs for malicious behavior
- **Hybrid Analysis** ‚Äì Deep malware behavioral analysis and dynamic sandboxing reports 

Each tool is documented in its own Markdown file, covering:
- Core purpose and use case  
- Practical walkthroughs  
- Screenshots and analysis examples  

üìÅ Folder: `Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-Tools/`

### 2. CTFs & Projects
This folder contains hands-on exercises and scenarios designed to simulate real-world CTI investigations.

- **Friday Overtime** ‚Äì Investigating and correlating threat indicators as a CTI analyst  
- **Trooper** ‚Äì Using CTI methodologies to identify adversaries based on reports and intelligence  

Each CTF or project file includes:
- Scenario description and objectives  
- Investigation process and findings  
- Screenshots and reasoning  
- Lessons learned  

üìÅ Folder: `CTFs & Projects/`

## üîß Tools & Technologies Used
During these labs and exercises, I gained practical experience with:

- Threat Intelligence Platforms: **MISP**, **OpenCTI**, **Abuse.ch**, **Cisco Talos**, **PhishTool**, **VirusTotal**, **Hybrid Analysis**
- Threat Hunting Tools: **Yara**, **Sigma**, **URLScan.io**, **OSINT utilities**
- Lab Environments: **TryHackMe**, **Virtual Machines**
- Documentation: **Markdown**, **Screenshots**, **Lab Notes**

## üå± Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, I have:

- Developed a strong foundation in **threat intelligence gathering and analysis**  
- Learned to **correlate Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** across multiple CTI platforms  
- Gained experience with **malware tracking and phishing analysis tools**  
- Strengthened analytical and investigative thinking for **intelligence-driven defense**

‚≠ê **Note:** While some labs were guided by TryHackMe, the work here demonstrates independent application and hands-on experimentation within the field of Cyber Threat Intelligence.
