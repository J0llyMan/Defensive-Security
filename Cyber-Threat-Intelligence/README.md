# 🧠 Cyber Threat Intelligence

This module covers my hands-on learning and practical application of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).  
It is organized into two main areas: **Threat Intelligence Tools** and **CTFs & Projects**.

## 📂 Folder Structure

### 1. Threat Intelligence Tools
This folder contains the CTI tools I have studied and practiced with, including:

- **Yara** – Writing and using Yara rules for malware analysis, forensics, and threat hunting  
- **OpenCTI** – Understanding the structure and visualization of threat data  
- **MISP** – Learning how to share and correlate threat indicators effectively  

Each tool is documented in its own Markdown file, covering:
- Core purpose and use case  
- Practical walkthroughs  
- Screenshots and analysis examples  

📁 Folder: `Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-Tools/`

---

### 2. CTFs & Projects
This folder contains hands-on exercises and scenarios designed to simulate real-world CTI investigations.

- **Friday Overtime** – Investigating and correlating threat indicators as a CTI analyst  
- **Trooper** – Using CTI methodologies to identify adversaries based on reports and intelligence  

Each CTF or project file includes:
- Scenario description and objectives  
- Investigation process and findings  
- Screenshots and reasoning  
- Lessons learned  

📁 Folder: `CTFs & Projects/`

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
During these labs and exercises, I gained practical experience with:

- Threat Intelligence Platforms: **MISP**, **OpenCTI**, **MITRE ATT&CK / DEFEND**
- Threat Hunting Tools: **Yara**, **Sigma**, **OSINT utilities**
- Lab Environments: **TryHackMe**, **Virtual Machines**
- Documentation: **Markdown**, **Screenshots**, **Lab Notes**

---

## 🌱 Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, I have:

- Developed a strong foundation in **threat intelligence gathering and analysis**  
- Learned to **correlate Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** across multiple tools  
- Gained experience with **threat sharing and reporting platforms**  
- Strengthened analytical and investigative thinking for **intelligence-driven defense**

⭐ **Note:** While some labs were guided by TryHackMe, the work here demonstrates independent application and hands-on experimentation within the field of Cyber Threat Intelligence.
