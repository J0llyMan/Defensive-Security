# Defensive Security Labs

This repository contains my hands-on labs, experiments, and projects in **Defensive Security**.  
It covers a broad range of topics, including:

- Cyber Defense Frameworks  
- Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)  
- Network Security & Traffic Analysis  
- Endpoint Security  
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)  
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)  
- Phishing Analysis  
- Capture the Flag (CTF) exercises

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
During these labs, I have gained practical experience using a variety of tools:

- **Endpoint Security:** EDR platforms, Windows & Linux hardening  
- **SIEM & Log Analysis:** Splunk, ELK Stack  
- **Network Security:** Wireshark, pfSense, firewalls  
- **Threat Intelligence & CTI:** Open-source threat intel feeds, MITRE ATT&CK framework  
- **Forensics & Incident Response:** Autopsy, Volatility, FTK Imager  
- **Phishing & CTF Labs:** Simulated phishing analysis, attack/defense exercises

## ðŸ“š Learning Platforms
While a portion of the hands-on experience was guided by **TryHackMe labs**, I complemented this with:

- Self-configured home labs in VirtualBox and VMware  
- Realistic network and endpoint simulations  
- Independent CTF challenges to apply concepts practically

This approach ensures that my learning is **both structured and self-driven**, giving me practical skills that extend beyond a single platform.
